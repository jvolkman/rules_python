    Args:
        name: {type}`str` The wheel filename
        metadata_name: {type}`str` The package name as written in wheel `METADATA`.
        group_deps: {type}`list[str]` names of fellow members of the group (if
            any). These will be excluded from generated deps lists so as to avoid
            direct cycles. These dependencies will be provided at runtime by the
            group rules which wrap this library and its fellows together.
        requires_dist: {type}`list[str]` The list of `Requires-Dist` values from
            the whl `METADATA`.
        extras: {type}`list[str]` The list of requested extras. This essentially includes extra transitive dependencies in the final targets depending on the wheel `METADATA`.
        entry_points: {type}`list[dict]` A list of parsed entry point definitions.
        include: {type}`list[str]` The list of packages to include.
        group_name: {type}`str | None` name of the dependency group (if any).
        dep_template: {type}`str | None` The dep_template to use.
        data_exclude: {type}`list[str]` The globs for data attribute exclusion.
        enable_implicit_namespace_pkgs: {type}`boolean` generate __init__.py files for namespace pkgs.
        sdist_filename: {type}`str | None` The filename of the sdist.
        namespace_package_files: {type}`list[str]` A list of labels of files whose directories are namespace packages.
        filegroups: {type}`dict[str, list[str]] | None` A dictionary of the target names and the glob matches.
        copy_files: {type}`dict[str, str]` The mapping between src and dest locations.
        copy_executables: {type}`dict[str, str]` The mapping between src and dest locations for executables.
        srcs_exclude: {type}`list[str]` The globs for srcs attribute exclusion.
        data: {type}`list[str]` A list of labels to include as part of the `data` attribute.
        action_install: {type}`bool` Whether to install the wheel in a build action.
        extracted_files: {type}`list[str]` Relative paths under the installed wheel directory.
        shebang_scripts: {type}`list[str]` Top-level script names in `.data/scripts/` with `#!python` shebangs.
        sdist: {type}`dict | None` Keyword arguments for `py_sdist_wheel` (plus `build_requires` and `site_paths`) when building an sdist in an action.
        visibility: {type}`list[str]` The visibility of the targets.
        **kwargs: Extra args passed to the {obj}`whl_library_deps_targets` and {obj}`whl_library_srcs`.
