    [cf]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-skylib/blob/main/docs/copy_file_doc.md

    Args:
        additive_build_content (str, optional): Raw text to add to the generated `BUILD` file of a package.
        copy_files (dict, optional): A mapping of `src` and `out` files for [@bazel_skylib//rules:copy_file.bzl][cf]
        copy_executables (dict, optional): A mapping of `src` and `out` files for
            [@bazel_skylib//rules:copy_file.bzl][cf]. Targets generated here will also be flagged as
            executable.
        data (list, optional): A list of labels to add as `data` dependencies to the generated `py_library` target.
        data_exclude_glob (list, optional): A list of exclude glob patterns to add as `data` to the generated
            `py_library` target.
        filegroups (dict, optional): A mapping of filegroup target names to glob patterns (or include/exclude dicts).
        sdist_build_deps (list, optional): Explicit build dependency labels for `py_sdist_wheel` when building an sdist in an action.
        sdist_config_settings (dict, optional): PEP 517 `--config-settings` key/value pairs for `py_sdist_wheel`.
        site_paths (list, optional): Override predicted `site-packages/` paths when building an sdist in an action.
        srcs_exclude_glob (list, optional): A list of labels to add as `srcs` to the generated `py_library` target.

    Returns:
        str: A json encoded string of the provided content.
